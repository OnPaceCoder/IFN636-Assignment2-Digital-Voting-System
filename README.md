**CI/CD Detailed Workflow**

-

1. Triggers

```yaml
on:
 push:
   branches: [main]
 workflow_dispatch: {}
```

- The workflow triggers when anything is pushed to "main" or manually run via the Actions tab (workflow_dispatch)

2.  Set up job

```yaml
jobs:
 test:
   name: Run Tests
   runs-on: self-hosted
```

- It executs the job on our own runner, self-hosted(EC2)

3. Strategy

```yaml
strategy:
     matrix:
       node-version: [22]
   environment: MONGO_URI
```

- It runs the job with Node.js version 22 and sets the job's deployment envrionment name to MONGO_URI

4. Checkout repository

```yaml
steps:
     - name: Checkout Code
       uses: actions/checkout@v3
```

- It pulls the exact commit that triggered the workflow

5. Install Node.js

```yaml
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
```

- This job uses Node 22 for builds.

6. Stop PM2 apps

```yaml
      - name: Stop PM2 apps
        run: pm2 stop all
```

- It stops all PM2-managed processes to avoid any conflicts during redeploy

7. Installs backend dependencies

```yaml
  - name: Install Backend Dependencies
        working-directory: ./backend
        run: |
          npm install --global yarn
          yarn --version
          yarn install
```

- It installs yarn and the backend packages under backend folder

8. Installs frontend dependencies & build

```yaml
   - name: Install Frontend Dependencies
        working-directory: ./frontend
        env:
          CI: ""
        run: |
          df -h
          sudo rm -rf ./build
          yarn install
          yarn run build
```

- It builds the production react bundle into frontend/build/ and CI: "" it avoids treating warnings as errors during CI.

9. Run all the backend test files

```yaml
   name: Run Backend Tests
              working-directory: ./backend
              run: npm run test
```

- It will run all the test files in the backend folder it uses chai and mocha to do the unit testing of all the functions written in all controller files.

10. Install dependencies at root and create .env

```yaml
   - run: npm ci
      - run: |
          cd ./backend
          touch .env
          echo "${{ secrets.PROD }}" > .env
```

- It installs the dependencies at root using npm ci and it creates .env file inside backend folder and writes all the environment variables to it.

11. Start/Restart PM2 apps

```yaml
    - run: pm2 start all
    - run: pm2 restart all
```

- It starts and restarts all the PM2 apps to ensure the latest code is live.
